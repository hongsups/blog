He diligently uploaded a daily update during the conference, which was impressive. Inspired by him, I’ve decided to follow his practice and to write notes during my attendance in the FAccT 2021 this year.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Markdown and GitHub for Scientific Writing</title><link href="https://hongsups.github.io/blog/collaboration/2020/11/24/github-manuscript-review.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Markdown and GitHub for Scientific Writing" /><published>2020-11-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-11-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://hongsups.github.io/blog/collaboration/2020/11/24/github-manuscript-review</id><author><name></name></author><category term="collaboration" /><summary type="html">Last year, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to do a poster presentation at the Scientific Computing in Python (SciPy) conference.

I’ve never had a chance to present my ML work as a paper in industry, and so I thought it would be a good experience.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Efficient Bug Discovery with Machine Learning for Hardware Verification</title><link href="https://hongsups.github.io/blog/ml/verification/2020/09/22/arm-rsh-blog-verification.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Efficient Bug Discovery with Machine Learning for Hardware Verification" /><published>2020-09-22T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-09-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://hongsups.github.io/blog/ml/verification/2020/09/22/arm-rsh-blog-verification</id><author><name></name></author><category term="ML" /><category term="verification" /><summary type="html">Imagine designing a highly complex machine. In order to be certain that it functions as its design specifies and does not have any bugs, you would need to test every aspect of the design exhaustively. If the machine is controlled by a set of knobs that can be turned on and off, this verification process can get exponentially complex. For instance, with a machine that has 100 binary on-off knobs, then 2100 tests need to be run to cover all possible combinations. If we assume that a single test takes one second to run, this equates to 1022 years of testing. For present-day microprocessors, it is even more challenging. There can be thousands or tens of thousands of two-state flip-flops in a single microprocessor. Therefore, it is impossible to verify microprocessor designs exhaustively.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Critiquing and Rethinking at ACM FAT 2020</title><link href="https://hongsups.github.io/blog/conference/fairness/ml/2020/03/01/acm-fat-2020.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Critiquing and Rethinking at ACM FAT 2020" /><published>2020-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://hongsups.github.io/blog/conference/fairness/ml/2020/03/01/acm-fat-2020</id><author><name></name></author><category term="conference" /><category term="fairness" /><category term="ML" /><summary type="html">ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAT*) is a computer science conference that aims to bring together “researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAccT) in sociotechnical systems” to nurture multidisciplinary approach and collaborations. Fortunately, I was able to attend the conference every year since 2018 when it first started. I attended the entirety of the conference, which includes tutorials, main conference, and the Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency (CRAFT) session. (FYI, The conference affiliated with ACM in 2019 (Atlanta, GA) and changed its name to ACM FAccT immediately following this year’s conference in Barcelona, Spain.)</summary></entry></feed>
