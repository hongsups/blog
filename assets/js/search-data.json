            "title": "FAccT Day 1. AI Audit, Governance, and Trustworthiness",
            "content": "This year, for the first time, the FAccT conference has more than one track and there are 27 sessions (+80 talks) happening in 3 days. This is a summary of the first day of the main conference. My summary is based on the talks I attended based on my interest. . Keynote . As a person who’s been attending FAccT every year, I’ve been familiar with the criticism to the FAccT academic community; many studies appeared here are often too abstract or disconnected from the real world and the impacted communities. The organizers are aware of this and they have been making efforts such as organizing CRAFT (Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency) sessions where they bring more multidisciplinary stakeholders. I considered the first keynote from today, given by Yeshimabeit “Yeshi” Milner, the executive director and co-founder of Data for Black Lives (D4BL), as a signal from the conference saying that they are actively working on this criticism. In this regard, it was an excellent keynote speech to kick off the conference. . At the very beginning of the talk, Yeshi said, “we will never achieve fairness, accountability, and transparency without first demanding justice, power, and self-determination.” Again, this directly points out that without a holistic approach where we bring all the stakeholders, achieving justice and making changes isn’t going to happen. Yeshi then talked about racial disparity examples where Black people were discriminated and disproportionately affected in a negative way, especially in healthcare. . She introduced the COVID-19 Data Tracker Project where organizers in the D4BL members compiled a dataset by themselves to highlight the stark disparities in health outcomes related to COVID-19. She mentioned that the larger goal here is to “build the political power of Black communities” as well, which is a critical point. She also emphasized that any intervention that does not build political power or agency of the marginalized community is liable to harm rather than to help. Considering that even some tech-for-good projects with good intentions often sideline those who are affected by the system, her remark was poignant. . “We need to think ‘who do we need to be’” At the end of the talk, she mentioned the importance of reflection, and said we need to resist the urge to feel compelled to keep moving forward, but to pause and reflect on ourselves. This involves identifying what we should unlearn and how we need to create new spaces to bring people who are directly impacted. I think this passionate and moving speech from Yeshi sent out this important message to all attendees, especially to academics and tech workers, like myself. . Algorithm Audit and Impact Assessment . For tech workers who are interested robust and responsible AI like myself, case studies are like gems. We are always curious about how others do things and want to learn from each other. That’s why I was very happy to see a case study about algorithm audit from Wilson et al., Building and Auditing Fair Algorithms: A Case Study in Candidate Screening. . Researchers from Northeastern University worked with Pymetrics, a company that uses gamification and AI to assist hiring in other companies. This collaboration itself was a unique instance because most audits happen internally or in a permission-less form where the companies being audited do not cooperate with the auditors. The academic researchers seemed to be quite transparent about the process (e.g., they revealed they were paid but the audit was done independently) and disclosed some problems in Pymetric’s system based on the criteria they used. I don’t know the full details yet but it was nice to hear that Pymetrics started working on solutions to fix these. . Speaking of the audit, there was another interesting paper about Amazon’s questionable practice in product recommendation. It’s been known that Amazon created their own private brand and started competing against other brands. The paper, When the Umpire is also a Player: Bias in Private Label Product Recommendations on E-commerce Marketplaces investigates this issue by conducting a systematic audit on Amazon’s recommendation system. They found that Amazon’s private brand has greater exposure in the sponsored ads by comparing related item network (RIN) models between the private brand’s and others’ networks. . Finally, there was a paper dedicated to algorithmic impact assessment. The authors in the paper, Algorithmic Impact Assessments (AIA) and Accountability: The Co-construction of Impacts, pointed out that often poor impact assessment practices neither mitigate harm nor bring effective algorithm governance. They emphasized that impact assessment should be closely related to accountability, especially for both institutions and people who are affected. The paper showcases impact assessment examples from different domains, which will be useful to design an effective and accountable algorithmic impact assessment procedure. . Trust in AI . Speaking of impact assessment, if we have incredibly thoughtful (which is probably very detailed) impact assessment and documentation of deployed algorithms, does it bring more trust? The paper, The Sanction of Authority: Promoting Public Trust in AI, says, perhaps not. The authors bring up the example of aviation industry. When we board on a plane, do we want to see the maintenance log, history of pilot performance to reassure ourselves? Or, do we normally trust that aviation is “highly regulated, comparatively safe, and any breach of safety will be sanctioned”? The authors suggest that the latter is how public trust is formed. This is an excellent point. Documentation of deployed AI systems can be as bad as terms of service statements, which usually have extremely poor readability and can be easily manipulated. I liked that the authors emphasized both the importance of regulatory system but also of externally auditable AI documentation, which would facilitate the development of AI regulations. . Explainable AI . How Can I Choose an Explainer? An Application-Grounded Evaluation of Post-hoc Explanations was a case study of comparing various XAI methods (LIME, SHAP, and TreeInterpreter) and how human participants use explanations to perform fraud detection task. I was hoping to see a discussion of comparison and evaluation of various XAI methods in a standardized way but it was more about evaluating the suitability of these methods using case-specific real-human tasks. I’d like to take a deeper look at the paper to see whether the authors mentioned any suggestions on cases where it is challenging to run those tasks. . Data Governance . My favorite talk of the day was Towards Accountability for Machine Learning Datasets: Practices from Software Engineering and Infrastructure by Hutchinson et al. . It’s not too difficult to meet ML practitioners who are obsessed with state-of-the-art deep learning models and conveniently ignore training data and how their data is preprocessed. These people often have a tendency of even looking down upon data preprocessing process and consider it demeaning. This paper takes a jab at this phenomenon. . The authors first talk about data scapegoating. Even though everyone is well aware of “garbage in, garbage out” relationship between data and ML models, often data is overlooked and undervalued. Many ML practitioners depend on benchmark datasets, which “reinforce the notion of data as fixed resources.” In my experience, this tendency intensifies the fanaticism on ML algorithms even though they are just a tiny part of a much bigger picture. With many good off-the-shelf models readily available, frankly speaking, models are rather becoming commodities. . They also point out the lack of good governance practice in data maintenance. Understanding ML model performance often requires good and detailed understanding of training data. However, validation and verification of training data is rarely conducted in ML engineering pipelines. . Finally, the authors didn’t forget to mention the power imbalanced between ML practitioners and data providers. I often feel extremely fortunate that I have experienced the entire end-to-end process of an academic research. I started from scratch and designed a process to collect the data by myself, which required great care and intense labor. In the current ML trend, this step is often conveniently removed and thus creates a bad habit of ignoring labor and responsibility in the data collection and development process. . I really appreciated the simplicity of the authors’ suggestion on this problem; “acknowledge that datasets are technical infrastructures.” Since many ML practitioners are familiar with tech infrastructures such as software programs, the authors suggest that we simply apply existing practices to datasets; create requirements, design, and tests. Once this formally becomes a part of infrastructure, it also becomes easy to get all the existing stakeholders in the pipeline involved. .",

            "title": "Notes on FAccT 2021 Tutorial Sessions",
            "content": "Last year during the SciPy 2020 conference, I participated in a mentoring program and I’ve got to know a fellow data scientist, Henrik Hain. He diligently uploaded a daily update during the conference, which was impressive. Inspired by him, I’ve decided to follow his practice and to write notes during my attendance in the FAccT 2021 this year. . Conference Overview . The conference is held virtually this year for the obvious reason. It’s on a platform called circle.so. Everything happens in one platform; video streaming, general announcement, community boards, internal messaging, etc., which is pretty convenient. . As an international virtual conference, the schedule is a bit brutal. For my time zone (UTC-6), the schedule starts at 6 am and lasts until 4-7 pm in the evening. Talks in the main session are pre-recorded and thus attendees can watch at their convenience but some sessions occur in real time. Luckily, the conference organizers set up dedicated watching times for the main session, which I really appreciate. . Today was about tutorials. I attended the following: . Causal Fairness Analysis | Explainable ML in the Wild: When Not to Trust Your Explanations | Responsible AI in Industry: Lessons Learned in Practice | A Behavioral and Economic Approach to Algorithmic Fairness &amp; Human-Centered Mechanism Design | How to Achieve Both Transparency and Accuracy in Predictive Decision Making: an Introduction to Strategic Prediction | . Each tutorial was about 90 minutes, which was a bit short for me. Since FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) topics are highly diverse, it makes sense to have many different tutorials. But because they were so short, they weren’t much of a deep-dive and an overview (at least for the ones I attended). . Causal Fairness Analysis . This tutorial was about conducting fairness analysis through causal framework by using structural causal models (SCMs). The speaker (Elias Bareinboim) started the talk by mentioning that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in discrimination lawsuit, meaning they have to prove the causal connection if they were treated unfairly. I found this emphasis and motivation from legal lense quite refreshing. . The material was relatively easy to follow in the beginning where Elias explained SCM models and how we evaluate them with given empirical data. However, it got a bit challenging to follow where we started combining fairness and causal models, especially given that fairness metrics are so diverse. . For me the most interesting part was where Elias compared various counterfactual scenarios. I’ve always assumed that the causal DAGs will not change when we switch the group membership to simulate counterfactuals, but obviously there is no guarantee. It’s possible that we can have indirect and spurious effects for counterfactual scenarios and he explained that we need to subtract those effects from direct effects. . Explainable ML in the Wild: When Not to Trust Your Explanations . This tutorial consisted of three parts: overview of explainable AI (XAI) methods, their limitations and ethical/practical challenges. I found the second part most interesting. . The speaker (Chirag Agarwal) introduced four aspects of XAI limitations: faithfulness, stability, fragility, and evaluation gap. Faithfulness refers to whether explanations change when models changes (and perhaps also the Rashomon effect). Stability refers to whether post-hoc explanations are unstable with respect to small non-adversarial input perturbation. For instance, some evidence shows that LIME explanations may change if we change random seed in certain ML algorithms. We also wouldn’t want our models to chance explanations based on hyperparameters. . Fragility is about whether explanation changes according to data drift in input space. This is closely related to adversarial attack on explanations (i.e., whether small perturbation can change explanation without changing prediction). Finally, in general, it is very difficult to properly evaluate XAI methods and currently there is no ground truth for evaluation. . Perhaps because of these problematic features, the case studies presented in the following session felt very nuanced and complicated. As I’ve seen in other responsible AI talks, XAI methods are closely related to human-in-the-loop systems and the level of trust in human end users. . Responsible AI in Industry: Lessons Learned in Practice . This talk consisted of two parts: overview of responsible AI tools and related case studies. These tools are useful for model monitoring/inspection, generating explanations, fairness mitigation, error analysis, and counterfactual analysis. I was surprised that there are already several open-source tools available such as InterepretML, Fairlearn, What-If Tool. . The live demo from Microsoft was impressive but it was too fast to follow (I personally think Jupyter notebook isn’t the best method for presentation if we have to go back and forth a lot). Also I was not sure whether the examples were from deployed projects or toy datasets especially since the speaker talked about fairness mitigation and I was curious about how the full cycle of mitigation process looked like. . The case study from LinkedIn at the end was interesting (especially since they presented similar material last year at the same conference) but it felt somewhat disconnected for the same reason I just mentioned above; I wasn’t sure how human end users were involved in the fairness mitigation process. . A Behavioral and Economic Approach to Algorithmic Fairness . This talk was about looking at the fairness problem from economic perspective. Different from the traditional computer science approach, this talk suggested that economic approach presents the fairness problem in the form social welfare functions where social planner can optimize efficiency (expected outcome of interest among groups) and equity. . What was interesting was that the optimal algorithm isn’t just about prediction function but also about admission rule, meaning how social planner can use the predictions to make decisions. Normally, these admission rules are threshold-based; we make a decision on certain group of individuals based on certain thresholds, which is affected by equity preference of social planner. Another interesting aspect was that this equity preference can even affect the prediction function because decision makers who prefer discrimination may want to use additional features from data to discriminate protected groups. . How to Achieve Both Transparency and Accuracy in Predictive Decision Making: an Introduction to Strategic Prediction . The whole idea of strategic prediction is very interesting because it’s about human users trying to game the system if they start understanding the rule of the game. For instance, if students learn about the criteria universities use for their admission process, they will try to find ways to cross that threshold so that they can be admitted. This tutorial gave an overview of this phenomenon from the perspective each stakeholder group in the process; institution (algorithm designers), individual (data provider), and society (all people as a whole). . Instead of doing a deep dive on a specific topic, the tutorial presented various topics in the domain. Recourse and incentivization was one of them. If the deployed algorithm uses a feature that can harm individuals because the feature incentivizes them to behave in a certain way, automated harm at a massive scale will be expected. Another way to look at the strategic prediction is through causality. If we find a true causal relationship between features and model predictions, it might be able to utilize the benefit of strategic prediction from the institution’s perspective and to encourage improvement without encouraging gaming, which will be crucial for modellers. .",

            "title": "Markdown and GitHub for Scientific Writing",
            "content": "Last year, I was fortunate to have an opportunity to do a poster presentation at the Scientific Computing in Python (SciPy) conference. Every presenter has an option to submit a written proceedings and I decided to participate. I’ve never had a chance to present my ML work as a paper in industry, and so I thought it would be a good experience. . I was a bit intimated when the conference committees said authors should submit their manuscripts as pull requests in their proceedings repository in GitHub. They also said manuscripts should be written in reStructuredText. I have used git for many years but I have limited experience in collaborating with others on GitHub. Plus, I’ve never used reStructuredText (I’ve only used Markdown) and also have never written an academic manuscript in markup languages. . In short, I eventually became to really enjoy the process of using markup languages for writing manuscripts and using GitHub for review. I will briefly talk about my experience at the SciPy and talk about why I think you should give it a try. . Scientific writing in markup languages . There was a bit of learning curve but it wasn’t too difficult to get used to the reStructuredText syntax because there were some similarities between Markdown and reStructuredText (rst). The conference committee also provided examples. They also provided me with a PDF builder that I could run locally. This helped me preview the final version of the PDF when it’s fully rendered. This was useful especially to decide the location of figures. There was a custom LaTeX builder in their repository too, which was invaluable. . Compared with existing word processor softwares such as MS Word or Google Docs, using markup languages pose some challenges to the first-time users. First, you need to learn the syntax. There are some limitations on styling because not everything is rendered automatically (e.g., LaTeX) and sometimes you need to play with html and css files to get a more complex page layout. . However, there are many benefits as well: . Every styling is written explicitly (e.g., ** for bold in Markdown) and thus it is easily discoverable. | Code snippets can be automatically rendered in a standardized way. | It’s easy and fast to publish the manuscript online, which makes it easy to share. | Finally, with a right document builder, the above-mentioned pain points can be mitigated. | It is much easier and convenient to review the manuscript (see below). | . Using GitHub for submission and review . . . Once I finished writing the manuscript, I submitted the main document and image files as a pull request. It was pretty straightforward because I was working alone in my own branch (you can find my pull request here). A few weeks later, two reviewers started commenting on my pull request. The whole process was quite simple and very similar to a typical review process in academia: reviewers left comments on certain parts of the manuscript and I responded. It also reminded me of a code review process. This year, I volunteered at the SciPy 2020 as a reviewer. I reviewed a paper that was submitted as a pull request. . Benefits of GitHub for reviewing manuscripts . With these experiences, I learned that markup language with GitHub review process provides many benefits for scientific writing, compared with MS Word or Google Docs which are used in typical (academic) review process: .   Markup + GitHub review MS Word or Google Docs + Academic review . Discover exact changes | Yes | Possible but can be confusing when many changes occur in one place | . Change versions easily | Yes | May need multiple versions (separate files) | . Track communications | Yes | Challenging because comments happen in the margin, which has a very limited space. Otherwise, they are addressed in a separate space (like a letter). | . Text override or unauthorized edits | No (permission needed) | Can happen if tracking option is off or multiple files exist | . Group communication | Yes | No. Normally reviewers don’t talk to each other. Reviewers communicate individually with authors. | . Immediate responsiveness | High (online comments) | Low. Letters or emails need to be exchanged, which can take months. | . Communication transparency | High | Almost none (academic review). Normally double-blind. A reviewer can’t normally read other reviews during the review process. | . Public transparency | Yes (public repositories) | Almost none. Very rare to publish the whole conversation between reviewers and authors. | . One place for everything | Yes | No. Normally non-document type files exist in a different place. | . In short, the main benefit of using GitHub for reviewing manuscript comes from that GitHub is an excellent version control tool. It prevents reviews (new changes) and the manuscript (original file) from getting mixed up and allows us to track changes meticulously. . Another huge benefit is transparency. If our repository and pull requests are public, the entire review process can be seen by anyone. This way, every decision making process is tracked and stays public, which minimizes potential dispute or abuse between authors and reviewers. Given that academia is not capable of perfect self-governance and some academic disciplines have reproducibility problems, transparent review process like this can become a solution. . Final thoughts . It is true that markup languages may not always be perfect for writing a manuscript. Some people are more familiar with traditional word processing softwares where styles are immediately rendered and more style options are available. However, based on my experience with the SciPy conference, especially, being at the both ends of the review process, I can say the benefits of using markup language for scientific writing and using GitHub for review outweighs its caveats. Manuscripts written in markup languages can be easily reviewed in GitHub where we can utilize its excellent built-in tools to achieve better tracking, communication, and transparency. .",

            "title": "Efficient Bug Discovery with Machine Learning for Hardware Verification",
            "content": "Imagine designing a highly complex machine. In order to be certain that it functions as its design specifies and does not have any bugs, you would need to test every aspect of the design exhaustively. If the machine is controlled by a set of knobs that can be turned on and off, this verification process can get exponentially complex. For instance, with a machine that has 100 binary on-off knobs, then 2100 tests need to be run to cover all possible combinations. If we assume that a single test takes one second to run, this equates to 1022 years of testing. For present-day microprocessors, it is even more challenging. There can be thousands or tens of thousands of two-state flip-flops in a single microprocessor. Therefore, it is impossible to verify microprocessor designs exhaustively. . To work around this problem, hardware verification engineers use a method called random-constraint testing. This is more sophisticated than simple random adjustment of knobs – it is a hybrid approach of manual control and randomization. Engineers can direct the test behavior to a degree by setting constraints for the tests using adjustable knobs. Once constraints are set, the rest of the verification process depends on randomization; the knobs start subsequent processes that are stochastic, which stimulates various parts of the design. This way, engineers can explore the design randomly under the constraints they have set. . This method works well when engineers have not explored the design much. As engineers start exploring a design, they find and fix bugs, and the more they explore, the fewer bugs are left to be fixed. Eventually, it becomes very difficult to detect these rare bugs by random probing. Most of the hardware verification effort goes into finding the few remaining bugs in the design. In fact, this process is so time-consuming that 60-70% of the compute time spent on hardware development goes into verification. . If the random-constraint testing is not good at specifically targeting bugs in the design, what are the alternatives? My team in Arm Research has been working on this problem since last year. We have analyzed our CPU verification data and successfully trained machine learning (ML) models to solve this problem. We deployed an ML application with these models in collaboration with production engineers at Arm, Mark Koob and Swati Ramachandran. Our application uses ML to flag tests that are likely to find bugs. Verification engineers can feed a large group of prospective tests to our application, and then the application returns a subset of them that are likely to find bugs. This way, engineers can focus on these tests only, and reduce the number of tests to run, which eventually saves compute costs. . Currently, our application is being used consistently by Arm verification engineers as a complementary tool to their existing workflow. On average, it has been shown to be 25% more efficient than the default verification workflow in terms of finding bugs, and 1.33x more efficient at finding unique bugs. Through our application, engineers were able to find more unique bugs per test run when compared to their existing verification workflow. . Filtering prospective tests using ML . . Now let us take a deeper look at how our application works. The main challenge of using ML for hardware verification is that everything revolves around random-constraint testing. Not only is the data collected by this method, but also the testing infrastructure is built to optimize this process. The problem is that random-constraint testing consists of two very different parts: . Deterministic knob-control by verification engineers, and; | Non-deterministic subsequent processes that are random and intractable. | . This means two things. Firstly, the only source of the usable data is the knobs. Secondly, we cannot guide tests directly to explore new design space because the whole process is non-deterministic. . Let’s first look at the knob data. Here, each sample is a test that was run in the past. It has several hundred knob values (input) and a binary output; bug or bug-free. In our data, bugs were extremely rare (less than 1%). To address this severe class imbalance, we adopt two approaches. Firstly, we train a supervised learning model that computes a probability of having a bug based on a set of knob values. This model detects tests that may expose bugs similar to the previous ones. Secondly, we train an unsupervised learning model that estimates similarity between a new test and the previous tests. If the similarity is low, the test is likely to be novel. Novel knob combinations can probe unexplored design areas and are more likely to expose bugs. In our preliminary results, we found that these models can detect different types of bugs. Since our main goal is to capture as many bugs as possible, we flag a test as a bug provided one of the two models predicts it will be. . To avoid the difficulty in guiding test behavior, we choose a filtering approach. We leave the knob values to be generated randomly from the testing infrastructure and filter them afterwards based on ML prediction scores. To do so, we need to provide the ML models with a large group of knob values (test candidates) first. Luckily, this process is computationally cheap. Then, the ML models compute prediction scores (the probability of having a bug) of the candidates. Based on the scores, we select a subset of the candidates that are more likely to find bugs than others. . Deploying ML within existing random-constraint testing infrastructure . Now that we have trained ML models ready, can we completely replace our existing random-constraint testing flow with our application? The answer is no. The filtering approach, even with the unsupervised learning model, does not completely solve the exploration problem. That is why the existing flow (random-constraint testing) should remain. The random probing can still be useful for exploration to a degree, and can provide new training data for model update. Thus, we propose two parallel pathways; one with the default randomized testing and the other with ML models, where an additional set of test candidates are provided and then only the tests flagged by the models are filtered and run. This way, it is possible to continue collecting novel data from the default flow for exploration while exploiting the data from previous tests via the ML application. . Some may think that our job is done when the models are delivered, and deployment finally happens. This is not true. For the models, a new journey begins when they are deployed in the production environment, because it is likely that unexpected events are waiting for them. For instance, we have learned that design and testing infrastructure go through daily changes, so test behavior and data generation process may change frequently. This means the models deployed in the beginning do not guarantee good performance as time goes by. . To address this, we have conducted research into the optimization of model retraining. We identified how often models need to be retrained and how much data should be used for training. Using this information, we’ve built a retraining module that is automatically invoked periodically or upon verification engineers’ request. During the retraining process, we compare a variety of different models and tune their hyperparameters. This allows for flexibility across changes in data generation processes and various microprocessor designs. . Towards end-to-end ML . When we talk about ML, the focus is often on algorithms. As I mentioned, however, when it comes to building ML products, the algorithms are only a small part of a much larger pipeline. Especially with scalable deployment in consideration. Starting from data acquisition all the way to deployment and assessment, every step requires attention of data scientists and ML researchers. It is because developing ML products is different from typical software development. A lot of processes are interconnected and data-dependent, which makes them more challenging to test and evaluate. . Admittedly, we initially approached the development of this ML application as a “throw it over the wall” type of engagement. After developing the core ML modules (data preprocessing and models), we delivered them to production engineers without much engagement afterwards. After the application was deployed in several projects, we occasionally needed to intervene to deal with unexpected model behavior. We soon realized that not engaging in the deployment process makes it very difficult to solve any issues that happen after model deployment. . Recently, in collaboration with our colleagues, it has been made easier to make direct contributions to packages. They have developed a Python package for data science and ML, which has become a core part of our ML application. This allowed us to directly contribute to the ML application easily, and also enabled scalable Python in Arm’s internal compute platform. Our new team member, Kathrine (Kate) Behrman has already built a new module to fix an existing problem in model validation. With this momentum, we are more engaged in deployment to make our ML application perform better and more reliable, while exploring new research ideas. . Through this process, we learned that getting more involved in ML product development provides many benefits to researchers. First, it makes tech transfer much easier because making direct contributions to deployed products is more frictionless. This also means that we can test our new research ideas easily and measure the effect quickly. In addition, it helps us fix problems efficiently because we have better understanding of how the models are served in deployment. ML products benefit from an evolutionary approach because there is no absolute guarantee that the data or surrounding infrastructure stays the same. Finally, this process naturally brings automation and scalability, which makes our work easily applicable and more impactful. . Next steps . We are currently working on launching a new version of our ML application to accommodate a new CPU project that has launched recently. We expect that the new version can be used in the early stage of verification, which is new territory to us. At the same time, we are exploring various research areas. For example, explainable AI for feature assessment and counterfactuals, various unsupervised learning techniques to target novel bugs more effectively, methods to design ML-friendly test benches, and other verification-related problems such as assessing coverage. We are also putting efforts into standardizing our workflow and automating existing features. We anticipate that our work will bring more consistent and reliable model performance over time. We also expect that it will showcase a successful tech transfer example for ML deployment that can be applied to solving other engineering problems inside Arm with ML. .

            "title": "Critiquing and Rethinking at ACM FAT 2020",
            "content": "ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAT*) is a computer science conference that aims to bring together “researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency (FAccT) in sociotechnical systems” to nurture multidisciplinary approach and collaborations. Fortunately, I was able to attend the conference every year since 2018 when it first started. I attended the entirety of the conference, which includes tutorials, main conference, and the Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency (CRAFT) session. (FYI, The conference affiliated with ACM in 2019 (Atlanta, GA) and changed its name to ACM FAccT immediately following this year’s conference in Barcelona, Spain.) . What’s new . Compared to the last year’s event, the organizers made several changes to reflect that FAccT topics require a more holistic view rather than a pure computer science one. In addition to the computer science (CS) track, they created tracks dedicated to social sciences and humanities (SSH), and legal scholarship (LAW). They have also added the CRAFT session, inspired by the NeurIPS 2018 Workshop, “Critiquing and Correcting Trends in Machine Learning” (CRACT). The session focused on critiques of the field of FAccT, such as its blind spots, omissions, or alternative possibilities that take a more holistic approach. This is to give voice to those who suffer the impact, daring formats and beyond academia. . Tutorials . This year, the tutorials are divided into four categories (hands-on, translation, implications, and invited). The hands-on tutorials included explanatory tools (Google’s What-If and IBM’s “AI Explainability 360”) and University of Colorado’s fairness-aware recommendation package called librec-auto. These are useful tools, but I assumed I could learn about these tools on my own from their websites. Instead, I attended translation and implications tutorials where the former includes topics on ethics, law and policy, and the latter is about case studies of FAccT topics in industry. Interestingly, some of the translation tutorials focused on positionality, the social and political context that influences, and potentially biases, a person’s unique but partial understanding of the world. Here is the summary of the tutorials I attended. . Explainable AI in Industry: Practical Challenges and Lessons Learned . This tutorial discussed several techniques on how to provide explainability in ML models and introduced several case studies. Generally, there are two approaches to achieve explainable AI. We can build an interpretable model such as linear models or decision trees, or we consider coming up with post-hoc explanation for a given model. We focused on the latter. The post-hoc explanation approach can be rephrased as the “attribution” problem. In other words, we want to know why a model makes a certain prediction and attribute the model decision to the feature of an input. The main technique we discussed, integrated gradients1 address this aspect by interpreting explainability as feature gradient. For instance, if I changed a feature X, and then the target Y has changed, we may consider the change of X as an explanation to change of Y. Integrated gradients are model-agnostic interpretation of this idea. Here, we look for feature regions where model performance changes dramatically (i.e., large gradient) and integrate them to create an explanation. One application example was diabetic retinopathy to predict severity of the disorder in retinal images. The method was able to provide explanation to deep learning model prediction by locating retinal legions. Although this is useful for its model-agnostic approach, it still lacks global explanation. . Leap of FATE: Human Rights as a Complementary Framework for AI Policy and Practice . Even though AI governance has emerged as a hot topic, many are disappointed by the current ethical framework for AI-related problems. The speakers suggest that we can use human-rights based approach to bring more rigorous and specific groundwork for AI governance. Existing treaties or resolutions such as Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UHDR) or International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) are good examples. Adopting a human rights perspective for AI governance provides several benefits. First, these are well-established universal standards that have been existing for many decades. Second, they have more currency than ethics, and thus provide better accountability especially when these are violated (i.e., violation to human rights). Since these resolutions are much more specific than ethics, it is possible to make human rights impact assessment of AI technology and companies who own it. . Two computer scientists and a cultural scientist get hit by a driver-less car: Situating knowledge in the cross-disciplinary study of F-A-T in machine learning . This tutorial focused on positionality and attempted to give audience first-hand experience of how researchers’ perspectives and approaches can differ across many disciplines. After a brief introduction, we were split into several groups and read three papers all from different disciplines such as computer science, social science and philosophy. The computer science paper was about identifying racial bias in online comments. The social science paper discussed intricate relation between racial minority and their particular usage of certain words in English. In addition to using several questionable methods, the authors from the first paper clearly lacked domain knowledge. Thus, the conclusion of this paper inevitably made a blanket statement on the topic, which was inaccurate and ignorant. It was a good hands-on exercise on the importance of domain knowledge and collaboration across multiple disciplines, which is usually required in FAccT-related studies. . Main conference . There were three keynote talks and 15 sessions of talks for accepted papers. These sessions are grouped into the following topics: . Accountability | Explainability | Auditing/Assessment | Fairness | Ethics and Policy | Values | Data collection | Cognition and education | Sensitive attributes | . Keynote . They were given by Ayanna Howard from Georgia Institute of Technology, Yochai Benkler from Harvard Law School, Nani Jansen Reventlow from Digital Freedom Fund, which supports partners in Europe to advance digital rights through strategic litigation. Howard’s talk was about human bias in trust in AI. She provided examples from her experiments using robots and how human participants interacted with them. In one of her experiments, she found that humans can overly trust AI decision (a robot’s decision in the experiment). She mentioned that understanding cognitive bias is crucial when designing an AI system. Benkler’s talk was on the role of technology in political economy. He discussed how technology has been contributing to the increase of productivity but also aggravating the concentration of wealth, which led to more severe economic inequality. Finally, Reventlow discussed how we can sometimes use litigation strategically to make industry and government more accountable. She mentioned that the best way to build a strategic litigation case is to make the litigation itself embedded in a broader case and to bring various stakeholders such as activists and policymakers together. . Accountability . The first paper2 criticizes that the term “algorithmic accountability” is inherently vague and thus it needs specification in terms of “the actor, forum and forum, the relationship between the two, the content and criteria of the account, and finally the consequences which may result from the account.” Raji et al.3 also mentioned that due to this vagueness, there is a gap in algorithmic accountability. The authors showed ways to overcome this by illustrating how other industries such as aerospace, medical devices, and finance conduct audit and carry out governance. Finally, Katell et al.4 gave an actual example where researchers co-developed algorithmic accountability interventions (“Algorithmic Equity Toolkit”) by adopting participatory action research methods in collaboration with American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU-Washington). . Explainability . There were many interesting papers in this section. Sokol and Flach5 provided convenient yet exhaustive explainability fact sheets for project assessment. Malgieri and Kaminski6 criticized that even though explainability is addressed in GDPR, there is no consensus on what it entails. They also made an excellent point that explanation does not necessarily provide justification on fairness. Barocas et al.7 criticized the faulty assumptions often made when models provide explainability or actionability. For instance, to change the model prediction of an individual, the model may make suggestion to the person to make more money, which is not exactly easily actionable. They suggest that there should be fiduciary obligations on explainability, and we should study how people actually respond to the explanations. Lucic et al8 created Monte Carlo Bounds for Reasonable Predictions (MC-BRP), which generates feature values that would result in a reasonable prediction (i.e. a range of predicted values), based on the n most important features, and general trends between each feature and the target variable, such as whether the target value increase with a certain feature. Bhatt et al.9 conducted a survey on how industry handles explainability in deployment. Their results showed that explainability is mostly used for debugging and the goals of explainability are not clearly defined. Some ML engineers they talked to also addressed that there is technical challenge in real-time deployment for explainability. Hancox-Li10 discussed so-called “Rashomon effect” where multiple models of similar performance provide different explanations, which makes difficult for stakeholders to choose which explanation to believe. . Auditing/Assessment . Black et al.11 presented a model-agnostic tool that can be used in the exploration stage to identify discriminatory behavior in ML systems. Their concept is roughly based on counterfactuals but they addressed that coming up with a right causal diagram is often challenging. Instead, they used a technique called an optimal transport map, which transforms one probability distribution into another, while minimizing a given cost defined over their respective supports. For example, we might use an optimal transport map from the distribution of men to women in order to obtain a (female, male) pair of inputs with which to query the model. If the model’s output differs for these two people, then it may be evidence that the model discriminates on the basis of gender. Rodolfa et al.12 did a case study in collaboration with a local government to show how to balance equity and model performance depending on which fairness metric to choose and how it affects certain demographics. Lum13 audited a pre-trial risk assessment tool from San Francisco, CA, and found that overbooking (i.e., booking charges that are dropped or end in an acquittal) increased the recommended level of pre-trial supervision. Sánchez-Monedero et al.14 criticized that some automated hiring systems developed in the US were used in the UK and other European countries where the transparency and data protection law background is quite different from the US. Borradaile et al.15 investigated how the Corvallis (Oregon) Police Department has used social media to monitor certain users and found that they have outsourced the task and racial bias existed among those who were monitored. . Fairness . Slack et al.16 developed Fair-MAML, which demonstrates K shot learning for cases where the number of training samples is extremely small. Barabas et al.17 introduced a concept of “studying up” commonly used in the field of anthropology, which refers to studying “the relative upper hand” in terms of the amount of agency and authority they have in a given context such as established legal systems or law enforcement. Pujol et al.18 showed a study of conflict between differential privacy and fairness, and suggested to customize privacy implementation for each assignment instead of using differential privacy for all tasks. Liu et al.19 looked at the complicated interplay between the deployed model for automated decision making in hiring, and individuals who are affected by the model. Because the model’s decision rewards people disproportionately, people tend to change their behavior in response to how these decisions are made. The authors showed that subsidizing the cost of investment create better equilibria for the disadvantaged group. Yang et al.20 examined the ImageNet dataset and found problematic behavior in how “person” category was constructed, for instance, due to lack of diversity in images and bias in annotation. Binns21 investigated the notion of individual and group fairness being in conflict and clarified it being based on a misconception, which requires resolution from a broader context and by focusing on the sources of unfairness. . Ethics and Policy . Washington and Kuo22 found that AI ethics codes from corporations conflated consumers with society and were largely silent on agency. They introduced the concept of digital differential vulnerability to explain disproportionate exposures to harm within data technology and suggest recommendations for future ethics codes. Bietti23 discussed a current trend in tech industry where self-regulation or hands-off governance prevails and “ethics” is increasingly identified with technology companies’ self-regulatory efforts with shallow appearances of ethical behavior, so-called “ethics washing.” Abebe et al.24 states that computational research has valuable roles to play in addressing social problems. . Values . Dotan and Milli25 the rise and fall of certain model types. They argue that the rise of a model- type is self-reinforcing and the way model-types are evaluated encodes loaded social and political values such as centralization of power, privacy, and environmental concerns. Venkatasubramanian and Alfano26 criticizes the current conceptualization of algorithmic recourse, the systematic process of reversing unfavorable decisions by algorithms and bureaucracies across a range of counterfactual scenarios, and suggests both stakeholder and expert panels should establish acceptable action sets (i.e., not one-way), make a role for fiduciaries who are charged to act on behalf of those they represent, and handle the changes over time (i.e., ongoing engagement). . Data collection . In this section, various authors criticized that the current data collection practices in industry and governments lack transparency and standardized approach. Geiger et al.27 investigated human- annotated datasets widely used in the ML community and found that the so-called benchmark datasets have questionable reliability in the first place. Marda and Narayan28 investigated predictive policing system in New Delhi to discover the lack of public accountability mechanisms, biases that are present within Delhi Police’s data collection practices and how these translate into predictive policing. . Cognition and education . Bates et al.29 collected data from MSc Data Science teaching team based at University of Sheffield to reflect on their experiences of working at the intersection of disciplines such as FATE (i.e., FAT + ethics). Based on their findings, they suggest to create empathetic learning spaces for interdisciplinary teaching teams and collaborate with decolonization experts to avoid Eurocentrism with data science competency in mind. . Sensitive attributes . Bogen et al.30 brings up the topic of data collection on sensitive attributes such as race and gender specifically for interventions for antidiscrimination. They illustrated case studies from several industry domains such as credit, employment, and healthcare, and found that the practices widely varies across the domains and also within in certain cases, such as whether the companies are bound by legal restrictions or they can collect self-reported identification as data. The paper encourages various stakeholders to actively help chart a path forward that takes both policy goals and technical needs into account. . CRAFT sessions . CRAFT stands for Critiquing and Rethinking Accountability, Fairness and Transparency (CRAFT) session. These are designed to bring more diverse voices on FAT* topics. I attended the following sessions. . When Not to Design, Build, or Deploy . Given the recent push for moratoria on facial recognition, protests around the sale of digital technologies, and the ongoing harms to marginalized groups from automated systems such as risk prediction, a broader discussion around how, when, and why to say no as academics, practitioners, activists, and society, seems both relevant and urgent. . Some of the notable topics the panel discussed include more case studies on the unnecessary surveillance driven by AI systems, raising tech workers’ agency (accompanied with ethics training for engineers), and making interventions at various points in a production pipeline, and so on. When it comes to how we would formalize the effort in terms of policy, some mentioned that engineers can potentially make released models more difficult to replicate, societies can apply similar regulations to AI as they do to any weapons, and governments can bring legal enforcement on the issue. . Centering Disability Perspectives in Algorithmic Fairness, Accountability &amp; Transparency . It is vital to consider the unique risks and impacts of algorithmic decision-making for people with disabilities. The diverse nature of potential disabilities poses unique challenges. Many disabled people choose not to disclose their disabilities, making auditing and accountability tools particularly hard to design and operate. Further, the variety inherent in disability poses challenges for collecting representative training data in any quantity sufficient to better train more inclusive and accountable algorithms. . Speakers mentioned that disability perspectives combine AI systems design and accessibility issues. This is similar to the lack of diversity issue in training data in face recognition. If deployed AI systems cannot recognize disabled people. This requires ML engineers to consider whom their models might fail for and consider inclusive and viable solutions in advance. The disabled community also has intersectionality because how disabled are represented in the media and society do not reflect the diverse spectrum of the disabled community. This is also related to that various demographic groups have different socioeconomic and genetic backgrounds that might affect the probability of them to become disabled. . Reflection and suggestions . Overall, it was nice to see the conference growing rapidly every year. I appreciated the organizers’ move to create separate tracks for social science and law, to encourage more holistic views in research. I enjoyed the CRAFT sessions very much. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the FAT* topics, sometimes I sensed that the one-way communication of the talk format has severe limitations on how we move further from here. The CRAFT sessions were the attempts to mitigate this issue and also bring the ground workers such as activists, lawyers, policy makers, industry data scientists together. . I also see there are room for improvements. First of all, every talk was strictly limited to 8 minutes, which was too short. Especially when it comes to computer-science papers, some speakers showed many math equations on their slides, which is probably not the best strategy for the 8-min talk. Some speakers did a great job of laying out the background knowledge but not all of them. If we are truly interested in multidisciplinary effort, improving the communication is crucial. . Speaking of communication, at the very end of the conference, there was a townhall meeting and the Q&amp;A was extremely short. I think this should be more focused because we are a group of various backgrounds and to make impactful changes from our research, it is important to open the floor for more discussions. This can be potentially mitigated by organizing birds-of- feather (BOF) sessions or group-lunch for certain topics. The conference is growing fast, which means we will have a lot of newcomers every year. It would be better for them to have easy-to- network venues. . The conference this year used an anonymous board to submit questions online and did not use their Slack channel much. I understand the need for anonymity but the Slack channel was extremely useful in terms of establishing networks between researchers from different domain and socializing. Tutorial preparation could have also been announced on the Slack channel as well like last year. There were some tutorials where the attendees didn’t get enough information about the preparation and it was a missed opportunity. . This issue was brought up last year but the conference may want to attempt to create a shared knowledge base to educate the attendees to have everyone on the same page. There are many definitions of key terms such as fairness, and there are important historic case studies researchers talk about all the time. It would be nice to have standardized material that is open to all attendees before the conference so that we can all well-informed and follow the conference material more easily. . This might be a radical and debatable idea, but if the conference is truly interested in tackling practical and more current issues related to the FAT* topics, they might consider bringing more industry people, especially the ones who are often criticized by various researchers to make them more accountable and help them create a better solution, instead of ostracizing them. Not all companies may participate but considering the urgency of the issue, it wouldn’t do any harm for us to reach out to industry and bring them to the table. This will also provide opportunities for researchers as well if the industry stakeholders share their difficulties of implementing good AI governance in practice, and the researchers can help tackling them. .

            "title": "Tech Policy Workshop and Data Ethics",
            "content": "As a data scientist working in industry, I frequently witness the impact a machine learning application can make. This impact often has a cascade of downstream effects which are inconceivable to a data scientist without enough domain knowledge. Nevertheless, under the widespread motto, “move fast and break things,” in tech industry, ML practitioners tend to care little about the size of their products’ impact. In certain cases, they even overlook scientifically rigorous evaluation of their products. These phenomena have been greatly worrying me ever since I started my career in industry. My concern has deepened due to many recent instances of AI applications reproducing human bias on a massive scale and aggravating existing socioeconomic problems. . Recently, I found out about the event, The Tech Policy Workshop at the Center for Applied Data Ethics at USF via Dr. Rachel Thomas on social media, as I have been enjoying her blog posts and talks. She is smart, honest, and concerned about the welfare of people and society. Thus, I assumed that the workshop would be beneficial in many ways. The lineup was also very interesting because the speakers had diverse backgrounds. Additionally, the low registration cost was helpful. . I have been interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency of ML for several years, and thus have been attending events related to the topics. Compared with those events, I found this workshop unique in two ways. First, the organizers made a great effort to gather experts from a wide variety of domains ranging from computer science to policymaking. This makes sense because tech ethics and policy are multidisciplinary issues. Second, by choosing the format of a workshop, instead of a conference, the event was more interactive. There were several hands-on exercises, which encouraged valuable discussions among the attendees. The workshop exceeded my expectations and I felt grateful for the opportunity to attend. . Interactive ethics exercise on facial recognition . Every session was interesting and unique in its own way. However, the main lesson I got out of the workshop came from the ethics session led by Irina Raicu from Santa Clara University. Ethics can be vague, abstract, and even esoteric but Irina made it sound accessible. She compared it to birdwatching; the more we learn about ethics, the more easily we can notice ethical issues in the world. Instead of giving a lengthy philosophy lecture, she taught us various easy-to-understand ethical “lenses”. She then asked us to use these in an exercise based on a real-world case about face recognition. The case was about a dataset1 that ML researchers at IBM created to train a fairer face recognition model. . I was already familiar with the case. Joy Buolamwini, a ML researcher at MIT, published a study2 that revealed gender and racial bias in the training dataset in many commercial face recognition platforms including IBM’s. After this paper was published, IBM was forthcoming about the issue and they promised to improve their application. It is safe to assume that IBM researchers had good intentions when they published a new training dataset. Unfortunately, we found that this new dataset still had many problems, especially related to data privacy. . During the exercise, we applied different ethical lenses to address which ethical values were pursued or violated. Since we were a group of data scientists, policymakers, and activists, there were a variety of ideas. I admit that in the beginning of the exercise, I was somewhat frustrated because ethics cannot be easily optimized. This meant that we might not be able to reach conclusions easily. However, once we started discussion, I realized that the true value of the exercise was not about finding the right answer quickly, but about evaluating various perspectives especially when multiple ethical values were in conflict. The exercise also taught me that ethical decision making is a highly dynamic process that requires a diverse set of opinions. I started thinking this type of exercise would be beneficial for tech engineers to change the way they think. . Ethics training for tech workers . Granted, as Chris Riley at Mozilla pointed out during his session, teaching ethics to engineers may not be the best way to solve the tech-related problems in our society. After all, ethics focuses on individuals. Typically, socioeconomic problems are solved more effectively through legislation, regulations, and policies. However, several speakers hinted that training engineers to learn about ethical decision making can still be useful. . Tech industry has great power and influence on our society . As Prof. Elizabeth E. Joh from UC Davis mentioned, tech industry has a significant amount of power these days. According to her, in certain circumstances, police must even drop their investigation so as not to violate the non-disclosure agreement related to the procurement of technological devices they use. She gave an example of police body-cams produced by the company, Axon, who dominates the market. They make almost every decision on how the device works, how and where data is stored and maintained, and so on. This means the management decision in the tech company can have a significant impact on the general public. Guillaume Chaslot from Algo Transparency delivered a similar message using an example from YouTube. It showed how slow and passive YouTube’s response was on content moderation. This is similar to Facebook’s naïve approach that contributed to the dissemination of disinformation over the internet, which created numerous sociopolitical problems all over the world. . Tech workers also have power . Multiple speakers emphasized that tech workers have great power as well. Recent tech employee walkouts demonstrate that power. Some even affected their companies’ decisions on certain social issues. The news3 about Google recently hiring firm known for anti-union efforts implies that companies now have recognized employee unrest as a threat. ML practitioners who work closely on sensitive datasets can wield even greater power. Kristian Lum from Human Rights Data Analyses Group shared a disturbing example of a ML application used at a government branch. A ML practitioner manipulated the results by hand-selecting model coefficients from multiple versions of a dataset, but this only came to light much later during an audit. Based on my conversations with other data scientists, proper oversight or formalized review of technical work is still missing in many industries. Under these circumstances, the responsibility to provide transparency and accountability falls to individual ML practitioners. Since building a ML application is a complex process, technical debt can aggravate quickly. . What I can do as a tech worker . The fact that ethics is about an individual’s decisions makes me think that there should be something I can do and that I should be aware of the responsibility that comes with my power as a tech worker. I can share a few things I try at work to make a change even though they are small. First, I seek out resources to learn about best practices in ML across the industry and to establish them at work regarding transparency and accountability. My team uses Model Cards4, which summarize how models are trained and how they are supposed to be used, and Datasheets5, which describe how data are collected, used, and processed. Second, to prevent technical debt, I often ask for reviews so that my work is seen by many different stakeholders. Another effort is bringing my work to a public space through publications, seminars, or conferences. For the tech ethics and policy issues, I try to take advantage of any opportunities inside my job (e.g., lunch-and-learn sessions) or outside (e.g., house parties or friends’ gatherings) to raise awareness. Finally, I try to learn more about the topics via events like this workshop. . What I can do as a citizen . I spent a lot of time thinking about what I can do as a tech worker, but I was forgetting something more important. At the end of the workshop, Prof. Elizabeth E. Joh talked about how tech companies wield their massive power in surveillance and policing. An attendee asked her whether there is anything we can do to make a change. Rather than answering his question, she asked him how many times he has previously attended city council meetings of his own city. She said there is still not enough awareness about this problem among the general public nor even momentum to create strong public opinion. That is why we need to raise our voices to address the issue and demand a change. Carrying out my duty as a citizen by speaking up was the one that I have overlooked. . At the workshop, I heard from Bay Area government officials about how they try to protect their citizens. Catherine Bracy from TechEquity Collaborative discussed organizations that help protect local communities from tech-related problems. Even though the Bay Area has been facing many problems such as housing and severe income inequality due to tech industry, it also has become the place where movements to fight back are pioneered. I think it has happened here because 1) it is the epicenter of the tech boom, 2) the severity of the problems is extreme, and 3) people are more aware of and sensitive about these issues. . Other local governments face a very different situation. The Litigating Algorithms report6 by the AI Now Institute mentions that many local governments are drawn to the idea of implementing automated decision processes (ADP) because officials expect ADP to save money. Since the governments do not have affordable access to the right talent, they end up outsourcing the work to cheap vendors who often do poor execution and do not provide enough transparency. The report lists many examples of ADP that went wrong and harmed many people. . Responsibility as a citizen and a tech worker . This workshop gave me an idea of how to combine my duty as a citizen and my duty as a tech worker. Government officials I spoke to at the workshop said it is extremely difficult for governments to catch up with the tech industry. It makes sense—policymaking is an inherently slow process but tech is all about fast developments and adaptations. To reduce the gap, we can start organizing small groups of tech workers to help nonprofits and local governments navigate the ever-changing tech space more efficiently. In the long run, these groups can form an advisory board or a civilian oversight committee to monitor tech-related issues in local communities such as predictive policing. By then, of course, these groups will include not only tech workers but other stakeholders such as local residents, legal experts, social scientists, activists, and more. This way, tech workers like myself can provide our local communities with technical expertise. At the same time, I will have a better idea of the real impact that my work makes. I optimistically believe that as we tech workers engage with our communities, we will change tech culture positively. . Final thoughts . In addition to learning much about tech ethics and policy, I found the workshop particularly special because I met great people from a variety of backgrounds, and I made new friends. I am sure many attendees had the same experience. It’s a rare occasion to have a diverse group of people sharing many concerns about the future in the same place for two days of honest discussions. . When I saw ads for the event, I hesitated whether I should register. I was unsure whether I would belong there because policy is outside of my experience. During the workshop, I confessed this to other attendees. Some said they had similar hesitations. After listening to my confession, Shirley Bekins, a housing activist who sat beside me, said with a big smile, “Of course you should be here!” . References . M. Merler, N. Ratha, R. S. Feris, and J.

            "title": "Fairness in Machine Learning at ACM FAT 2019",
            "content": "ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAT*) is a “multi- disciplinary conference that brings together researchers and practitioners interested in fairness, accountability, and transparency in socio-technical systems.” The conference originated from a fairness workshop in machine learning workshop at NIPS a few years and last year they had the first inaugural event as an independent conference. This year, they were joined with ACM and it was held in Atlanta, GA in Jan 2019. I attended both the tutorials and the main conference. . General thoughts . Compared to the last year’s conference, which I also attended, it seemed that the academic discipline has become more mature; last year, there were many talks focused on showing the examples of biased machine learning in practice and researchers discussed how they can agree upon defining terms such as fairness in mathematical concept. This year, there were many in- depth theoretical studies where researchers built mathematical models to simulate the propagated effect of bias in machine learning (ML). Empirical studies were also presented as well, in which researchers crowd-sourced data to show bias in human judgment especially when they interact with ML algorithms. Unfortunately, due to the recent long-term government shutdown, there weren’t many government officials who were supposed to participate. Hence, it was lacking to see how the discoveries made in academia can be translated into actual policies and legislation. However, it’s important to notice that there is huge growing interest in this field as ML-based algorithmic decision making is widespread in our society. . . Tutorials . For tutorials, I attended the Translation Tutorial: A History of Quantitative Fairness in Testing and Hands-on Tutorial: AI Fairness 360 Part 1 and Part 2. . The tutorials are divided into two categories: translation and hands-on. Since the conference is multi-disciplinary, there are attendees from various backgrounds; computer science, social science, law and policy, etc. . Translation Tutorial: A History of Quantitative Fairness in Testing . The translation tutorials are designed to have everyone more or less be on the same page. This specific translation tutorial I attended seemed to be aimed at computer scientists who are not much aware of the history of research on fairness and automated decision making. This was given by Google researchers Ben Hutchinson and Margaret Mitchell, who showed that the growing current interest on fairness in ML isn’t something new but existed in 1960’s when the civil rights movement started, which made sense. . Then, the interest was on designing fair standardized tests like SAT or LSAT. Based on correlation studies, researchers then discovered that standardized tests require specific cultural knowledge, which is unfair to racial minorities. There were several views on how to build a fairer model, similar to the various modeling perspectives found in modern studies, such as whether to use sensitive features like race or gender exclusively in models. Also, researchers then pointed out that what we are trying to predict and what we should do are two different questions, which is always mentioned in almost every presentation at this conference. . Ben and Margaret finished the talk by inspiring the audience with various research opportunities that we can learn from the history. For instance, these historical studies started by asking the question of “what is unfair?” instead of the definition of fairness itself. Correlation- based approach and addressing regression problem (instead of classification) in fairness are other examples. . Hands-on Tutorial: AI Fairness 360 . The second tutorial I attended (“AI Fairness 360”) was a hands-on one. Here, I learned about IBM Research’s effort to build an open-source Python package that implemented mathematical definition of various fairness criteria and how to apply them to a user’s existing workflow. The package seemed quite comprehensive and had great usability for the following reasons: . There is no one definition that satisfies all the needs and hence they have implemented a variety of metrics. | The package addresses different steps in ML pipeline where the fairness adjustment (i.e., mitigation algorithm) can be made: pre-process (mitigation to training data), in-process (mitigation to model during training), post-process (mitigation to predicted labels). This gives freedom and flexibility in the mitigation process. | Its syntax is similar to scikit-learn, which make everything easy and familiar. Plus, their API is well-established, and the repository has many notebook examples. | The package can have various types of data (tabular, images, etc.) | . This is just a start and of course, there are aspects that can be improved and investigated. First, some mitigation algorithms require tuning. It’ll be interesting to understand how this works on top of the main ML model’s tuning process. Since there are various fairness metrics, it would be nice to directly target those metrics for tuning. When a mitigation algorithm is applied, we sometimes see a compromise in model performance. In this case, it will be interesting to conduct an error analysis to find in which examples the model starts missing predictions. . Keynote . There were two keynotes from two very different domains: computer science and law. The computer science one was given by Jon Kleinberg at Cornell University. His talk was about mathematical formulation of a mitigation policy called Rooney Rule. The Rooney Rule is a requirement that at least one of the finalists be chosen from the affected group. His researched showed that it not only improves the representation of this affected group, but also leads to higher payoffs in absolute terms for the organization performing the recruiting. He presented a mathematical proof to prove his point. His model has only three parameters: composition of pool (diversity), level of bias, and abundance of outliers (superstars) and he showed that with certain constraints, Rooney Rule can be used to improve to the utility of the entire group (not just for the minority). . The second one was given by Deirdre Mulligan from UC Berkeley. Her talk was on “fostering cultures of algorithmic responsibility through administrative law and design”. She started by citing the case Loomis v. Wisconsin where Eric Loomis challenged the State of Wisconsin’s use of proprietary, closed-source risk assessment software (COMPAS) in the sentencing of himself to six years in prison. His argument was that there was gender and race bias in the software, which was also addressed by many investigative journalists. One of the interesting and disappointing part of this case was that the court addressed that “it is unclear how COMPAS accounts for gender and race…”, meaning the lack of transparency of the software but also the lack of ability to handle these cases in law. To fix this problem, she emphasized that there should be case laws addressing limits and details of math and algorithms, but more importantly, a “contestable” design. This means whenever there is a wrong done to a person by automated decision, they should be able to contest on this algorithmic decision. . Main sessions . In total, there were 11 sessions and there was a wide range of topics ranging from problem formulation to content distribution and economic models. The following sessions stood out. . Framing and Abstraction . The talks in this session here mentioned that problems in ML projects can start from the very beginning where ML practitioners and data scientists start formulating ideas and framing problems. For examples, if what one wants to measure cannot be obtained or measurable, they use a proxy that is correlated to the original metric they wanted to measure. Sometimes data scientists transform a regression problem as classification by discretizing variables. Unfortunately, these decisions are often not well documented even though they happen in many layers in a ML project. . Profiling and Representation . Chakraborty at al. presented an interesting idea of handling online trolls in their talk, “Equality of Voice: Towards Fair Representation in Crowdsourced Top-K Recommendations.” Since algorithms trained by online user data make often offensive and biased prediction, they came up with a fairer “voting” system by considering that there are a few bad actors (the trolls) and that most users are silent (who don’t case a vote). Here, the main challenge was the latter because they need to infer how a silent user might have voted. To solve this, they used existing personalized recommendation techniques. . Fairness methods . In “From Soft Classifiers to Hard Decisions: How fair can we be?”, Canetti at al. tackles the fairness problem by implementing a deferral process. Instead of making hard yes/no decisions, the model can defer the decision to a group of moderators so that they can gather more information and make more socially-acceptable decisions. Their paper discussion a couple of options of deferrals: applying different thresholds per group for deferral or equalizing the accuracy with equal deferral rate. . Similarly, in “Deep Weighted Averaging Classifiers”, Card et al. questions when we should know when not to trust a classifier. On top of traditional model performance, they come up with a separate measure of model credibility which can address whether this model is a right tool. They provided a fun example where they build a model by using the MNIST dataset and then used the trained model on the Fashion MNIST (the former has images of numerical digits and the latter, images of clothes and shoes). The model can still make predictions but clearly this model is not built for the testing data. In this case, the model’s “credibility” is very low. . Explainability . Ustun at al. points out that explanability does not mean contestability in their talk, “Actionable Recourse in Linear Classification”. When a model explains why your loan is rejected, it doesn’t mean what you should do about it, especially the explanation is based on immutable features like your race. They suggest that we should have a system and model that provides “ability to obtain a desired prediction from a model by changing actionable input” so that the model’s explanation is actually useful. Their tool provides two answers: 1) what users can do to flip the decision and 2) the proof of no recourse (by checking every option in actionable features). The second answer can be still valuable because then it provides the user with contestable information. . Economic Models . There were two dedicated sessions just for economic fairness, new to this year’s program compared to the last year’s. One interesting concept discussed in multiple talks was “strategic manipulation.” It is also called “Stackelberg game”, where candidates might try to change their feature to game the system (the model) and the learner anticipates this and adjust the classifier by changing the decision boundary more stringent, which can also result in changes in candidates’ behavior. Milli et al.’s discussed in “The Social Cost of Strategic Classification” that so far the approach to this problem has institutional-centric view. For instance, when the institution, who build the model, wants to come up with a counter-measure to strategic manipulation, they weigh hard-to-change features such as parents’ income or zip code more highly. Then it becomes extremely high-cost for credit-worthy individuals in the wrong zip code area to obtain a loan, meaning the social burden is now on individuals. Their study found that as the game is played, individual social burden increases and returns more unfair outcome. . Summary . I enjoy this conference very much not just because of personal interest but also of the fact that studies discussed here emphasize robustness and responsibility of ML algorithms, often ignored in ML community. Plus, the crosstalk between different domains enlighten me because they the topics can be applied to many aspects of ML engineering work. The theoretical studies provide new insights on how to measure abstract concepts like fairness and bias, transferrable to processes like problem statement that are highly important in ML. The empirical studies help theoretical studies grounded and more realistic. Finally, the law and policy side of works emphasizes the real implementation of these studies, which resembles constructing deployment plans and the results with stakeholders. .",

          "content": "Hongsup / 홍섭 . I am a machine learning (ML) practitioner and a data scientist in Austin, TX. Currently I work in computer hardware industry as a machine learning researcher. I also volunteer at a local criminal justice non-profit in my spare time. My background is computational neuroscience and behavioral ecology. I have many interests but when it comes to ML, I am interested in how we can build fair, accountable and transparent ML systems. . I’m originally from Seoul, South Korea - “홍섭” is my first name in Korean. I like movies, photography, and board/video games. I identify myself as a scientist, engineer, immigrant, queer, and someone who falls somewhere between dilettante and polymath for a variety of subjects. . Blogging . I am a massive introvert but I do enjoy sharing my knowledge with others because that’s how I make new friends and truly learn about a topic in depth. Maintaining a blog is obviously a lot of work but I think it provides great opportunities to do what I enjoy. Plus, this blog uses fastpages, which makes it easy to publish posts that have a mixture of text, code, and (interactive) data visualizations. . I will be writing mostly about ML here but I can’t promise you that I will be strictly talking about ML all the time. This is simply because ML and AI affect many aspects of our lives already and I think, in general, technology should be discussed in a broader context including society and members of our community. . Asymptote . I used to love the idea of becoming a perfectionist. However, I soon realized that perfectionism is quite toxic; I never get to finish anything, my self-esteem gets eroded gradually and perpetually (because I will never be perfect), and it makes me shy away from presenting my work before others. . To be honest, I am still lured by the idea of perfectionism from time to time. But at least, I now know that perfection is an illusion. Instead of chasing after the illusive idea, I’ve learned to enjoy the process of getting better and improving myself. This involves sharing my work with others, exchanging feedback, having discussions, and making incremental changes. . Perhaps that’s why I’ve always been fascinated by the mathematical concept of asymptote. I will never be perfect but at least I will be doing my best to become better. .",
