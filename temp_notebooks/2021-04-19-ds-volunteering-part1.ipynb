    "\n",
    "It's 2021 now and almost everyone in the US is aware that there is an epidemic of police brutality all over the country. Academic researchers now agree that [police contact is a significant contributing factor to health inequality and particuarly to early mortality for people of color](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31383756/). The police brutality in the US is also internationally recognizied such as in [the 2014 report by the UN Committee Against Torture](https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/UN-Committee-Against-Torture-Concluding-Observations-United-States.pdf):\n",
    "> The   Committee   is   concerned   about   numerous   reports  of   police   brutality   and excessive use of force by law enforcement officials, in particular against persons belonging to certain racial and ethnic groups, immigrants and  LGBTI individuals, racial profiling by police  and  immigration  offices  and  growing  militarization  of  policing  activities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the issue of police brutality is this severe, one would expect that there might be a national database of police shooting incidents. **Unfortunately, the US goverment does not maintain a national database of police shooting incidents.** Rather, most efforts to collect police shooting incidents were done by journalists: D. Brian Burghart's [Fatal Encounter](https://fatalencounters.org/) and Washington Post's [Fatal Force](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/) are most populat examples. Some local goverments have pulic data portals for police shooting but they are mostly at a city level and it's rare to find a state-level database."
