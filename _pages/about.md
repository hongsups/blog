## Hongsup / 홍섭

I am a machine learning (ML) practitioner and a data scientist in Austin, TX. Currently I work in computer hardware industry as a machine learning researcher. I also volunteer at a local criminal justice non-profit in my spare time. My background is computational neuroscience and behavioral ecology. I have many interests but when it comes to ML, I am interested in how we can build fair, accountable and transparent ML systems.

I’m originally from Seoul, South Korea - "홍섭" is my first name in Korean. I like movies, photography, and board/video games. I identify myself as a scientist, engineer, immigrant, queer, and someone who falls somewhere between dilettante and polymath for a variety of subjects.

## Blogging

I am a massive introvert but I do enjoy sharing my knowledge with others because that's how I make new friends and truly learn about a topic in depth. Maintaining a blog is obviously a lot of work but I think it provides great opportunities to do what I enjoy. Plus, this blog uses [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), which makes it easy to publish posts that have a mixture of text, code, and (interactive) data visualizations.

I will be writing mostly about ML here but I can't promise you that I will be strictly talking about ML all the time. This is simply because ML and AI affect many aspects of our lives already and I think, in general, technology should be discussed in a broader context including society and members of our community.

## Asymptote

I used to love the idea of becoming a perfectionist. However, I soon realized that perfectionism is quite toxic; I never get to finish anything, my self-esteem gets eroded gradually and perpetually (because I will never be perfect), and it makes me shy away from presenting my work before others.

To be honest, I am still lured by the idea of perfectionism from time to time. But at least, I now know that perfection is an illusion. Instead of chasing after the illusive idea, I've learned to enjoy the process of getting better and improving myself. This involves sharing my work with others, exchanging feedback, having discussions, and making incremental changes.

Perhaps that's why I've always been fascinated by the mathematical concept of asymptote. I will never be perfect but at least I will be doing my best to become better.
